    Advancements in machine learning-driven sensing and decision-making algorithms have propelled significant progress in autonomous driving systems 
    over recent years \cite{ding2023survey}. Significant strides have been made since the inception of the first autonomous vehicle. The initial 
    successful test of an automated, radio-operated vehicle occurred in the USA on August 5th, 1921 \cite{kroger2016automated}. Subsequently,
     in 1953, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) Laboratories achieved a breakthrough by creating a miniature vehicle navigated and controlled 
     via wires \cite{mccready_report}. The advancement of Autonomous Driving experienced a significant leap forward in the 1980s, attributable 
     to the evolution of computer technology. In 1983, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated the Autonomous Land
      Vehicle (ALV) program in collaboration with institutions like Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Stanford University, and others 
      \cite{gage1995ugv}. This marked the first integration of LiDAR \cite{schwarz2010mapping}, computer vision \cite{janai2020computer}, 
      and automated control methods \cite{kuutti2020survey} for Autonomous Driving. By 1989, CMU had pioneered the application of neural networks 
      to steer Intelligent Vehicles, establishing a cornerstone for intelligent control methodologies \cite{pomerleau1988alvinn}.
