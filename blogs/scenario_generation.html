<strong >Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Advancements in machine learning-driven sensing and decision-making algorithms have propelled significant progress in autonomous driving systems 
    over recent years \cite{ding2023survey}. Significant strides have been made since the inception of the first autonomous vehicle. The initial 
    successful test of an automated, radio-operated vehicle occurred in the USA on August 5th, 1921 \cite{kroger2016automated}. Subsequently,
     in 1953, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) Laboratories achieved a breakthrough by creating a miniature vehicle navigated and controlled 
     via wires \cite{mccready_report}. The advancement of Autonomous Driving experienced a significant leap forward in the 1980s, attributable 
     to the evolution of computer technology. In 1983, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated the Autonomous Land
      Vehicle (ALV) program in collaboration with institutions like Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Stanford University, and others 
      \cite{gage1995ugv}. This marked the first integration of LiDAR \cite{schwarz2010mapping}, computer vision \cite{janai2020computer}, 
      and automated control methods \cite{kuutti2020survey} for Autonomous Driving. By 1989, CMU had pioneered the application of neural networks 
      to steer Intelligent Vehicles, establishing a cornerstone for intelligent control methodologies \cite{pomerleau1988alvinn}.
</p>

    To foster technology advancements in self-driving cars, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) orchestrated three competitions 
    over the last decade. The inaugural event, known as the DARPA Grand Challenge, took place in the Mojave Desert, USA, in 2004 
    \cite{badue2021self}. Participants were tasked with creating self-driving cars capable of traversing a 142-mile course along desert 
    trails within a 10-hour timeframe. However, all vehicles competing in the challenge failed within the initial few miles. No vehicle managed 
    to complete the course, with the highest-scoring one covering only 7.5 miles, resulting in the prize remaining unclaimed \cite{darpa_report}. 
    Nevertheless, the competition proved valuable, providing a hopeful preview of what could be achieved.
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Merely a day following the conclusion of the initial challenge, DARPA revealed plans for a second Grand Challenge to be held in the autumn of 2005 
    \cite{buehler20072005}. Building upon insights gleaned from the previous event, five vehicles, out of the 195 participating teams, triumphantly 
    navigated a 132-mile course in southern Nevada. The entry from Stanford University, named "Stanley" \cite{stanley_report}, clinched victory by 
    crossing the finish line first in 6 hours and 53 minutes, securing the \$2 million prize \cite{thrun2006stanley}. Their vehicle came equipped 
    with a camera, LiDAR, RADAR \cite{skolnik1962introduction, levanon1988radar}, Global Positioning System (GPS), and an Intel CPU. The primary 
    technological hurdle in crafting Stanley was to engineer a supremely dependable system, capable of navigating diverse and unstructured off-road 
    terrains at considerable speeds, all while maintaining exceptional precision.

    In a bid to set even higher standards, DARPA organized a third competition in 2007, known as the Urban Challenge \cite{darpa_urban_report}. 
    This event saw driverless vehicles tackling a sophisticated course set in a simulated city environment in Victorville, California 
    \cite{buehler2009darpa}. The vehicles had to navigate through moving traffic and obstacles while adhering to traffic regulations. 
    Out of the 11 participating teams, six successfully completed the course. The "Tartan Racing" team, headed by Carnegie Mellon University, 
    secured the top position by earning the highest points based on completion time and adherence to California driving regulations, 
    thus claiming the \$2 million prize \cite{urmson2007tartan}. It integrated an array of LiDAR, RADAR, and visual sensors to navigate 
    urban environments securely. While this competition marked the largest and most consequential event of its kind at the time, the testing 
    environment fell short in replicating certain elements of real-world urban driving scenarios, such as the presence of pedestrians and 
    cyclists \cite{yurtsever2020survey}.
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Following the DARPA Urban Challenge, numerous additional automated driving competitions \cite{broggi2012vislab, broggi2015proud, cerri2011computer, englund2016grand} 
    took place in various countries. The swift advancement of technology and regulations governing its implementation are propelled by the 
    collaboration among information technology and automotive sectors, academic and research organizations, the Defense Department and its 
    affiliates, as well as federal and state transportation authorities \cite{national2020ensuring}. 
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) delineates six levels of driving automation, ranging from 0 (fully manual) to 5 (fully autonomous), 
    which have been endorsed by the U.S. Department of Transportation \cite{sae_1, synopsys_report}. Researchers predict that by 2025, 
    approximately 8 million autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles will be on the roads \cite{sae_report}. By 2030, an estimated 82 million 
    Intelligent Vehicles (IVs) with Level 4/Level 5 capabilities are expected to operate in the US, Europe, and China \cite{consultancy_report}. 
    Despite the remarkable advancements in Autonomous Driving technology, significant challenges persist. One critical hurdle for their widespread 
    deployment in real-world settings is the evaluation of their safety. Intelligent cyber-physical systems face greater challenges in deployment 
    because our world is intricate and diverse, leading to significant uncertainty for the intelligent agents. Even for humans, mastering driving 
    skills requires several months due to the complexity of traffic scenarios \cite{ding2023survey}. Hence, Autonomous Vehicles (AV's) must undergo 
    extensive training and evaluation across various scenarios to showcase their safety and ability to handle diverse situations 
    \cite{zhong2021survey, riedmaier2020survey}.
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    In a technical report released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), it was revealed that 94% of road accidents stem 
    from human errors \cite{singh2015critical}. Given this context, Automated Driving Systems are being advanced with the potential to curb 
    accidents, cut emissions, assist mobility-impaired individuals, and alleviate driving-related stress \cite{crayton2017autonomous}. Nonetheless, 
    achieving reliable automated driving in urban settings remains a challenge.
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Achieving level four and higher driving automation in urban road networks poses an ongoing and formidable challenge. The environmental factors, 
    ranging from weather conditions to human behavior in the vicinity, are notably unpredictable and complex to anticipate. Moreover, system 
    failures have resulted in accidents: in the Hyundai competition, one of the Autonomous Driving Systems crashed due to rain \cite{hyundai}; 
    Google's Autonomous Vehicle collided with a bus while changing lanes because it failed to accurately gauge the bus's speed \cite{google_1}; 
    and Tesla's Autopilot failed to detect a white truck, resulting in a fatal collision with the driver \cite{tesla_1}.
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Furthermore, there have been additional occurrences of accidents involving self-driving cars. In November of last year, a pedestrian in San 
    Francisco was involved in a hit-and-run accident, where they were initially struck by a vehicle and thrown into an adjacent lane. Subsequently, 
    a Cruise robotaxi, unable to halt in time, collided with the pedestrian and dragged them. This incident compelled Cruise to recall 950 
    driverless cars from roads across the United States \cite{cruise_1}. Despite outperforming its rivals, Waymo has also experienced accidents. 
    Earlier this year, a driverless Waymo vehicle collided with a cyclist in San Francisco, resulting in minor injuries, prompting a review by the 
    state's auto regulators \cite{waymo_3}. Another incident in December 2023 involved two vehicles crashing into the same towed pickup truck in 
    Phoenix, Arizona, leading Waymo to initiate a voluntary recall of the software utilized in its robotaxi fleet \cite{waymo_2}.
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Accidents resulting from underdeveloped systems erode public trust and, tragically, result in loss of life \cite{hecker2018end}. Safety stands 
    as the top consumer apprehension regarding autonomous vehicles, with 36% of Americans expressing distrust in the technology's ability to ensure 
    the safety of motorists and pedestrians. The prevailing sentiment among consumers regarding how autonomous vehicles will impact America's 
    roadways leans towards negativity. Skepticism and concern are the predominant emotions surrounding self-driving cars, with nearly half (45%) 
    of consumers expressing either of these feelings. Conversely, only 16% of consumers report feeling excitement, with just 8% expressing an 
    overall positive outlook toward these vehicles \cite{forbes_1}. Consumer sentiment aligns with projections indicating slow growth in the 
    adoption of self-driving vehicles. Survey data reveals that self-driving cars are likely to remain a niche product, as 51% of consumers 
    indicate they are unlikely to own or use such vehicles within the next five years \cite{wash_1}. In contrast, only 14% believe they are 
    very likely to own a vehicle with self-driving capabilities. These findings underscore consumer concerns regarding the safety and reliability 
    of self-driving cars, suggesting that market growth in this sector is poised to be sluggish in the next five years. A significant shift in 
    public perception will be essential for self-driving vehicles to assert themselves as a dominant force in the U.S. auto market in the 
    foreseeable future \cite{forbes_1}. 
</p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Establishing public trust will require the development of more reliable and robust Autonomous Driving Systems that are less susceptible to 
    accidents. While current Autonomous Vehicles have achieved considerable success under normal conditions through extensive training spanning 
    hundreds of millions of miles, uncertainties remain regarding their safety and robustness in unique scenarios. For instance, encountering 
    unexpected situations such as a child suddenly darting into the driving lane to retrieve a ball poses a significant challenge for 
    Autonomous Vehicles, leaving them with minimal time to react. Even slight errors in response could result in serious consequences. 
    This underscores the critical need to conduct rigorous testing of self-driving cars' behavior in tailored safety-critical scenarios to 
    thoroughly assess the safety and robustness of Autonomous Vehicle Systems.

<p><strong >Diffusion Models</strong></p>
<p style="width:100%;max-width:900px;border:0px;border-spacing:0px;border-collapse:separate;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;text-align: justify;">
    Diffusion models \cite{sohl2015deep, ho2020denoising, song2019generative, song2020score, dhariwal2021diffusion, nichol2021improved, rombach2022high, croitoru2023diffusion, yang2023diffusion} 
    belong to a category of probabilistic generative models designed to reverse the gradual degradation of training data structure. The training 
    process involves two distinct phases: forward diffusion and backward denoising. During the forward diffusion phase, multiple steps are executed, 
    each involving the addition of low-level noise to input images. This noise's intensity varies with each step, progressively deteriorating the 
    training data until it becomes pure Gaussian noise. The backward denoising phase reverses this process by systematically removing the noise, 
    thereby reconstructing the original images. Consequently, during inference, images are generated by gradually reconstructing them from random 
    white noise. The noise subtraction at each step is estimated using a neural network, typically leveraging a U-Net \cite{ronneberger2015u} 
    architecture, enabling dimension preservation.

    Diffusion models are inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. They define a Markov chain of diffusion steps to slowly add random noise to 
    data and then learn to reverse the diffusion process to construct desired data samples from the noise. Unlike VAE or flow models, 
    diffusion models are learned with a fixed procedure and the latent variable has high dimensionality (same as the original data) 
    \cite{weng2021diffusion}.
